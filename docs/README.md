# Development Documentation

This directory contains documentation about the development process of cosmic-bing-wallpaper, created as an educational resource for understanding AI-assisted software development.

## About This Project

cosmic-bing-wallpaper was developed collaboratively between **Dr. Roy C. Davies** and **Claude** (Anthropic's AI assistant) using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code). The entire application—from initial concept to full-featured release—was built through natural language conversation across multiple sessions totaling approximately **8 hours**.

This is the first project developed using this approach, followed by [cosmic-runkat](https://github.com/reality2-roycdavies/cosmic-runkat). Both projects serve as case studies in human-AI collaboration for software development.

## Why Document This?

1. **Transparency** - Show exactly how AI-assisted development works, including the iterative process, mistakes, and corrections

2. **Education** - Help others understand the workflow of collaborating with AI on real software projects

3. **Research** - Provide data for studying human-AI collaboration patterns

4. **Reproducibility** - Allow others to learn from and build upon these techniques

## Key Insights

From developing this project, some notable observations:

- **Organic scope evolution** - The project grew from a simple shell script to a full GUI application through dialogue
- **Human as quality gate** - Every significant bug was discovered through human testing
- **Platform knowledge gaps** - Working with newer platforms (COSMIC) requires exploratory approaches
- **Architecture emerges from pain** - The best design often becomes clear only after experiencing problems
